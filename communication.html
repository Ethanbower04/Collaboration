    <h2 id="2"> Global Collaboration: </h2>
    <p>
        Computing developments means we no longer need local proximity to communication. We can instantanously communicate at any location on the globe providing we have an interent connection or signal. This has been massively advantageous to society as it allows communities to be connected and allows for remote collaboration.

    <h2 id="3"> Sharing Information: </h2>
    <p>
        With the introduction of the Internet and personal computers such as phones and laptops being commonplace communicating information has never been easier. Anyone can search for anything they want to know and find the answers instantly, which is benefial for the sharing of ideas and education of society.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4"> Multimedia Communication: </h2>
    <p>
        There are now many different ways people can communicate. We can send text messages, voice recordings, images or instantanously communicate by voice or video calls. Society has never been better connected as a result of computing
