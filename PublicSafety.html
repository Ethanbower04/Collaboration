    <h1>Computing saves lives</h1>
    <p>
        Computing has been a monumental help in ensuring public safety.
    </p>
    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>We use technology every day, yet many of us forget the true dangers of being online. It is with thanks to firewalls, anti 
        viruses and cryptograohy that our private information is not simply publically available to everyone at all times. You may 
        roll your eyes every time the authenticator asks for two factor authentication and you have to whip out your phone for the 
        5th time, but this is exactly how we keep your banking details and money safe.</p>
    <h2>Emergency Services</h2>
    <p>The use of real time data provided by software such as Find My iPhone and enhanced
        communication systems have meant that response times and coordination responses of first 
        responders have greatly improved. Furthermore, data analytics and machine learning algorithms 
        have helped law enforcement agencies predict where crimes will occur based on historical data, meaning resources can be 
        allocated more efficiently. This has also been used in healthcare, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, computing systems
        were used to track cases, predict outbreak hotspots, and manage resource distribution. Contact tracing apps also helped prevent
        the spread of the virus.</p>
    <h2>Natural Disaster Predictions</h2>
    <p>Computing allows for warnings of natural disasters. Countries such as Japan and Mexico use seisometer networks and real time data processing to detect primary waves, to warn for the more destructive 
        p waves. This data is analyzed in real time and alerts people and automatically stops trains or shuts down infrastructure before damage can occur.
        Atmospheric and oceanic data can also be analyzed such as wind patterns, sea temperatures and pressure systems to predict hurrican and typhoon paths
        and intensities. Increasingly, machine learning algorithms are being applied to improve forecasting accuracy.
        There are many more uses of technology which include:
        <ul>
            <li>Flood prediction and management</li>
            <li>Wildfire risk prediction</li>
            <li>Volcano eruption forecasting</li>
            <li>Tsunami prediction and detection</li>
            <Li>Tornado prediction</Li>
            <li>Drought forecasting and monitoring</li>
            <li>Landslide prediction</li>
            <li>Avalanche forecasting</li>
            <li>Heatwave monitoring</li>
            <li>Climate change models</li>
        </ul>
