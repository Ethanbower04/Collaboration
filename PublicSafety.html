    <h1>Computing saves lives</h1>
    <p>
        Computing has been a monumental help in ensuring public safety.

    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>We use technology every day, yet many of us forget the true dangers of being online. It is with thanks to firewalls, anti viruses and cryptograohy that our private information is not simply publically available to everyone at all times. You may roll your eyes every time the authenticator asks for two factor authentication and you have to whip out your phone for the 5th time, but this is exactly how we keep your banking details and money safe.</p>
